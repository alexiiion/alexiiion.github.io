# How to install, run, deploy

## Install dependencies

1. Install **Jekyll** on your local machine: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
2. Install the website dependencies by navigating to the theme directory and running `bundle install`
3. To run it locally, use `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace` to start the Jekyll server.

### Troubleshooting
The issues should be resolved as the Gemfile was updated appropriately, but just as notes:
- On Windows: [gem wdm issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32723710/add-line-of-code-to-gemfile-that-already-contains-that-line-of-code)
- Add webrick for Ruby 3.0: [issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523)


## Deployment

To update the website on https://interactive-structures.org/, you need to 
1. Run it locally using use `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which will update the `_site` folder
2. **Verify that you didn't break anything** at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
3. Push to the main branch, that's it.

(Backround: Pushing to the main branch will trigger an [Action](https://github.com/interactive-structures/interactive-structures.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) on github that copies the `_site` folder to the `gh-branch`, which is the content visible at https://interactive-structures.org/)
